            <h2> Dave Brubeck </h2>
            <p>Dave Brubeck was an American jazz pianist and composer known for his unconventional meters.

Some of his most popular compositions included <a href = "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKNZqM0d-xo" target="_blank"> 'Blue Rondo a la Turk'</a> and the song <a href= "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmDDOFXSgAs" target="_blank"> 'Take Five'</a> which was composed by Brubecks longtime partner, saxophonist Paul Desmond. 'Take Five' was the first jazz instrumental to sell more than a million copies.</p> 
            <h2> John Coltrane</h2>
            <p>A revolutionary and groundbreaking jazz saxophonist, John Coltrane was born on 23 September 1926, in Hamlet, North Carolina. Coltrane had created a definite sound of his own. Part of it was defined by an ability to play several notes at once, creating what would be later dubbed as his "sheets of sound."
Coltrane described it this way: "I start in the middle of a sentence and move both directions at once.‚Äù By 1960 Coltrane had his own band, they produced some of jazz's most enduring albums, including Giant Steps (1960) and <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNmpIA_bLcE" target="_blank"> My Favorite Things (1961).</a></p>
